# Machine Learning Project 3 – Convolutional Neural Networks

Course: DASC 41103 – Machine Learning  
Members: Coy Morris, Hunter Hill

## Project Overview

This project, completed for DASC 41103: Machine Learning, focuses on the design, training, and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network classifier implemented in Python. The objective is to demonstrate practical understanding of CNNs by building and optimizing an CNN model using a real-world dataset, while clearly communicating methodological decisions and results.
